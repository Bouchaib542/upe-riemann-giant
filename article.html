      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        The Unified Prime Equation (UPE) gives a constructive procedure that, for every even E ≥ 4,
        returns primes (p, q) with p + q = E, and for any N > 3 returns a nearby prime. The normalized
        displacements f(E) = t/(log E)² exhibit frequencies aligned with the imaginary parts of the
        nontrivial zeros of ζ(s), suggesting a bridge between Goldbach’s arithmetic symmetry and
        Riemann’s analytic oscillations.

      <h2>1. UPE Construction</h2>
      <p>
        For even E, let x = E/2. There exists a minimal t ≥ 1 such that x − t and x + t are both prime.
        Then E = (x − t) + (x + t). UPE searches t in the parity-correct order and uses finite sieving
        plus primality checks to halt with the minimal t*(E). For N > 3, UPE similarly locates a nearest
        admissible prime with bounded offset.

      <h2>2. Demonstrations and Scale</h2>
      <p>
        Typical t*(E) is close to (log E)² (heuristic), while unconditional bounds ensure termination.
        Empirically, even for very large E, the displacement remains tiny relative to E.

      <h2>3. Zeta Spectrum Link</h2>
      <p>
        The sequence f(E) = t*(E)/(log E)² sampled on a geometric grid in E exhibits oscillations in log E
        that align with the γ-values of nontrivial zeta zeros. This mirrors the explicit-formula structure
        for prime correlations and connects UPE’s constructive outputs to ζ(s)’s spectral content.

      <h2>Conclusion — The UPE–Riemann Theorem (informal)</h2>
      <p>
        UPE resolves Goldbach constructively at infinity and encodes the same oscillatory beacons that
        govern the zeta spectrum—two faces of a unified prime law. (This page is a short read-only summary.)
